      <h2>About Yuri</h2><br />
      <p>I've been working as a teacher my whole life. As much as I enjoyed it, I want to change it. Improve how people learn through technology.</p><br />
      <p>I've always enjoyed utlizing technology in my classroom and daily life, for its efficiency and conveniency.
      I love cooking, with the help of online cooking guide, it's like the chef is there to help me step by step.
      I also spend a lot of time on reading, carrying my tablet with me everywhere is much easier than the entire libary at home.</p><br />
      <p>Now, as a student at Thinkful, I couldn't be happier and motivated to explore behind the "scence". I can feel my heart beat racing whenever I think about working as a software engineer in the future.</p><br />
      <p>I trust my coding experience, work ethic and enthusiasm will well transfer into whatever the challenge you give to me.</p><br />
